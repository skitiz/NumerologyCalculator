# Numerology Calculator

## What is this project?
This is based of a chapter I read in `The Dark Arts by Richard Cavendish`. Its a fun code I wrote on the bus to school.

## What am I supposed to do?
Run the `python` file with `python numbers.py` or `python3 numbers.py`

_Note : I added a `sys.clear` which clears the terminal on Macbook/Linux but it won't work on Windows._


## Do I have any future plans for this?

* I want to add numerology based on birthday and current year too.
* And a more descriptive descriptions of each number.
